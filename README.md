# CY-microfarm
I would like to thank the wonderful mentors and the great admin people for the amazing job they did.
I did not have enough time to finish my project on time. I applied again for software development class and while waiting to get approved, I am going to continue working on the project and to learn more about c# that thanks to all of you I started to like it and to see it's importance and power in the software development field. thank you all and happy holidays!
